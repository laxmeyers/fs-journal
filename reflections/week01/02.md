## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
- they seem to be an add on to other classes like hover. They give an effect that you can change and alter how you like.
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
- the lower one takes over so you can change ones for things that are lower. so you can give and take away a class to give it something.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
- i am thinking you will lose track of what you need to use and they then can collide with each other
