## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- they have declaring a function making the function equal to a variable and then getting rid of the function word and making the arrow function equal to a variable.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
- parameters are what is in a function. Arguments will be passed to a function. This way you know if you look at the function it is a parameter and if you look at where that function is called it is an argument.
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
they are functions that take a function as a parameter. Like the interval function
