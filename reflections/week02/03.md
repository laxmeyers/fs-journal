## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
- there is the log and error ways. The error is what you want to see to know what exactly may be going wrong. While the log can help debug the code.
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
the elements tab lets you see that. When you can see exactly where the html is you can then see why it may be acting such a way. This allows you to also see what css is active at a time.
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
- One way is to code small and then see if that little part works. There is also making changes to the code in the elements tab to see how each little change will affect the page.
