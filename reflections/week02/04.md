## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
- you save some time. This way you can make the plan how you want without having to fix code a lot. This saves a lot of time and money.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
- I try to talk the problem through first to see if that will get me unstuck. If that doesnt work google is next. I like w3 schools and mdn documents. When that doesnt work try asking someone for some help.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
- that we need to plan before we take action in coding. This allows us to see what we may need to do. But on the other hand we cant spend too mucch time planning it. Make a simple rough draft and then get to work laying out the ground work.
