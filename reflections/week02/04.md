## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
- you save some time. This way you can make the plan how you want without having to fix code a lot. This saves a lot of time and money.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
- I try to talk the problem through first to see if that will get me unstuck. If that doesnt work google is next. I like w3 schools and mdn documents. When that doesnt work try asking someone for some help.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
