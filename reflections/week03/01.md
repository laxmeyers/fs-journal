## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
- being able to use classes in other files. This allows us to be able to organize a lot better.
2. How does export differ from export default?
- i think that the default lets you use aliases and functions in a file. This then lets you use that alias i think.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
- everything is really organized. With this you can make functions not accesible to the user so it is harder for them to just access what they want to whenever they want to.
