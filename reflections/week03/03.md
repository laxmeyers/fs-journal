## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
- prop and value. the prop is the key and the value is what is assigned to the key.
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
- we need to add a return for the obj and the prop. This allows us to never get undefined and see what was called from the object and not just the handler.
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
- to be able to hide some keys and values. The henalder can check and make sure to keep certain things hidden. While other things will be able to be accessed by the user.
