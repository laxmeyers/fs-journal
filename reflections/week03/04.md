> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
- if there is a lot of user input then there is a lot of push and pull. The observer pattern tries to mitigate all the need for that. There are one-to-many data points to make things event driven.
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
- there are three actor classes. There is the subject, observer, and the client.
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
- They seem to be able to look at what the user wants. It doesnt reload the whole page when you add something. there is also code that is used over and over again. This makes the code reusable.
