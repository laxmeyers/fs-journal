## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?
- to narrow down the search. This allows you to see only the ones you want to see that have those requirements met.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
- it starts with a ? and then has a key and value. They are easy to see as the key is on the left of the = and the value on the right. When you have more than one there is a & inbetween each of them.
3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
- to see all the ones with a certain requirement. This would allow the user to have a filter button to see only certain packages or whatever they are looking at.
