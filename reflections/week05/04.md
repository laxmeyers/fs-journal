## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?
- these are additional fields to show something. THey can be filled automatically from other databases
2. When might you use a virtual property? 
- I would use them to send forth some user info. This allows the frontend to get a users name and picture but none of the other stuff that is sensitive.
3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
- you drill into it by using the virtuals name. From there you then drill into it into the property or key you want like name or picture.
