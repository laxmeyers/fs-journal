## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
- they are routes within a page. This allows for pages to be withing pages from the looks of it I think.
2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
- to make subpages within a page kindof. This works when those pages are all connected with info but you feel different pages would be best.
3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
- yes you should be able to. Did't really see how. You would use them when they would need info to show on the page that that one page has.
