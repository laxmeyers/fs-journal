## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
- this is what the user or customer sees or the time they have using the site. Users should only see what they have access to when they should.
2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
- this makes people want to come to the site more. It makes it easier to do this from the beginning instead of changing and adding things as you go.
3. Why is the User Experience important?
- all sites are used by users. This means that if no one likes it no one will use it and the no traffic. This in turn loses clients and customers.
