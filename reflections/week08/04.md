## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- there is unit component and end to end testing. testing a function then testinga full component and then testing the full page.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- i think component is to make sure th DOM is working and you are able to get components to the page. Functions are easier to determine what and how they do things.
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- end to end i think. This is testing at the end to make sure the whole thing works. If all components work then it should all just work.
