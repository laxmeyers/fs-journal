## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
- we are using a notifications api to send out when poeple are tipped or reviewed in an email. We also decided to use sockets to try and make a live chat work.
2. What went well so far?
- working in a teram has gone well. We were able to divide and conqure while still helping each other out when we got stuck.
3. What would you do differently? Why?
- I would have a smaller team next time. This would allow us to work better together. With five there seemed to be a slow go in the beggining then we tripped over each other later on.
