## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
- value these directly contain values in their memory, reference this stores the reference to where the data is stored in memory, and pointer these will point to the data
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
- these are numbers or single characters. These are different in the sense that javasript could store full strings like this where as this can only handle one single thing of data.
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
- These store the string at a place and then the variable is the pplace in memory that stores where that data is.
