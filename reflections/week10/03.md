## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
- Information in a row is everything for that one specific point of data from id to name. For a column that would be all the stuff for id or name for multiple points of data.
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
- CREATE Table characters(name varchar(255),age varchar(255),description varchar(255),id int )
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
- To delete from table that would delete all data in the table. The drop table would drop the whole table where you would have to create table to start putting things back into the table again.
