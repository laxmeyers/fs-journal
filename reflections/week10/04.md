> **ðŸ“– [C# Enums](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums)**

## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
- they are strongly typed where you can have that many choices and only those. They allow you to work with numbers but name them so you know what the numbers mean or stand for.
2. How can you modify an Enum?
- You can change them if they are within the same type. To change the type would only be if the the other type allows the dat in it but to save some space.
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
- I could do this by allowing only so many categories to be choosed from.
