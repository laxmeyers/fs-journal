## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
- This allows us to have a class to be able to use that class for everything like a repo model. Or to create one for the repositories for all the crud methods you may ever use.
2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
- not all members are inherited. The constructor is never inherited and stays with that one class at all times.
3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
- this may not make it accessible to the one inheriting. if they are private they are only allowed in that class.
