## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
- a primary key is the key that identifies that relationship or data in that table. The foriegn key is what connects another table to the data in that row on that table.
2. What is an `Alias`?
- The alias is what that column will be known by. This helps you know the difference between multiple id's without permently changing the name of the column in any table.
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)


Select d.*, p.*, doc.* from doctors d
join patients p on p.id = d.patientId
join doctors doc on doc.id = d.doctorId;
```
