## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
- My main concern are of course finding a job. This has always been a big worry and will still be one. Codeworks has given me the confidnece in my abilities that i needed. I plan to manage time by finishing up the backend so i can then fully focus on the front end. If i get stuck anywhere on the back i will jump to the front to give myself a break. I want a semifunctional site by wednesday and fully functional end of day thursday.
